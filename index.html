        <!-- FOUNDER OF NATIVE STRENGTH -->



  <section class="box">

    <h1 class="herohead">Hyapatia Lee is the Founder of Native Strength</h1>


    <p class="bodytext">After experiencing a successful traditional ceremony to have a baby, Hyapatia began studying with two medicine men, a medicine woman (Gladys Tantaquideon, brother to the last chief of the Mohicans), and a Hawaiian Kahuna. These teachers shared traditional wisdom from the Mayan, Lakota, Cherokee, Hawaiian, and many other cultures.</p>

    <hr>

    <p class="bodytext">In 2001 Hyapatia was elected to the prestigious position of Blessed Woman for the Lost River band of the Cherokee. Every weekend she taught the people to speak Cherokee, conducted pipe ceremonies and presided over sweat lodges, healing ceremonies. As Hypatia began to teach the many things she had learned from the elders, it became apparent that this information was just as useful to the members of the Lost River band as it had been to her.</p>

    <h1 class="herohead">TEACHING TRIANGLES AND MEDICINE WHEELS</h1>

    <img class="picture" src="images/MedicineWheel_mainone.jpg" alt="medicine wheel main one - picture">

    <p class="bodytext">Teaching Triangles (one example directly above): Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Cum odio inventore architecto non. Temporibus saepe esse repudiandae ratione magni, impedit ipsum excepturi perspiciatis suscipit quidem fuga soluta dignissimos. Cum, suscipit. </p>

    <img class="picture" src="images/MedicineWheel_mainone.jpg" alt="teaching triangle - picture">


    <p class="bodytext">Medicine wheels (one example directly above) help us to remember and comprehend this complicated system. This collection became known as Native Strength as it awakens the strength that is inside each of us. </p>

            <!-- FOUNDER OF NATIVE STRENGTH, MAYBE A QUOTE BOX HERE AS I CALL IT -->


    <p class="quotebox">Hyapatia knew sharing this knowledge with the rest of the world would help heal many who were suffering. It would be a crime to withhold knowledge that could help others to live a better life.  </p>

    <h1 class="herohead">THANK YOU FOR HELPING HYAPATIA!</h1>




    <p class="bodytext">Hyapatia suffers from a rare condition known as panhypopituitarism, a complete lack of pituitary gland functions. As the pituitary gland is the master gland, this condition is life-threatening for several reasons. There is no cure. Contributions towards Hyapatia's Go Fund Me are always greatly appreciated.</p>
